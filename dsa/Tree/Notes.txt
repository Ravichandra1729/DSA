*General Tree can have multiple childrens their is No limitation
* Binary tree needs To have atmost 2 childrens(0,1,2)
* binary Tree divided into 5 types:
1)Full Binary Tree:(0,2)
	A full binary Tree will have 0 or 2 childrens,No 1 children node
2)Complete Binary Tree:
	A binary tree in which all the levels except last level is completely filled with Nodes or should fill from left
	last level==>a) completely filled
				 b) left-Right
3)Perfect Binary Tree:
	Type of binary tree in which all internal nodes contains 2 children and all leaf nodes 
	are present is same level
4) balanced Binary Tree :
	its a binary tree in which hight of left sub tree and right sub tree is differed by atmost 1 
	
	difference=hight of left subtree-highet of right subtree <=1
	hight of empty node is -1
5) pathological Binary Tree (Degenerate binary tree )
	where parnet node has only one child node 
	
Binary search Tree::
	3 properties needed:
	left subtree key lesser than node's key 
	right subtree key greater or equals to root key 
	left and right subtree must be binary tree
